📝 Google Sheets Integration

The contact form on the website is connected to a Google Spreadsheet.  
How it works:
1. When a user submits the form, the data (name, email, message) is sent directly to a designated Google Spreadsheet.  
2. This integration is implemented using a Google Apps Script.  

(Ensure you’ve set up the script and provided the necessary permissions for the form to work seamlessly.)
